    title: "The Bear: The family I never knew I wanted",
    content: `Before watching The Bear I thought it was just going to be a show that wouldn't stretch any limits or make anything new that hasn't been done before, and that it would just be a simple show about food and cooking and the ordinary things you expect from any normal show about food, But I was wrong, how how much was I wrong.`,
    content2: `Although the show bases itself around a struggling family diner, taken over by new management, the focus is far from cinematic food shots that make your mouth drool, it's more about the struggles of working in a kitchen, having to juggle a thousand different issues just to stay sane, confronting and understanding other people's complexities and emotions, dealing with loss, hopelessness and lack of self in a dreary world that leaves us waiting for that big moment, not the one where you achieve some greatness or a wanted possession, it's a big moment where everything could just work out and feel fine, even if it's just for a single moment.`,
    content3: `Even with all the harsh aspects of the show, 'The Bear' presents the other side of the coin just as beautifully as the other, where for every trial and tribulation, there exists a hopeful, heartwarming conclusion, where you see the characters face their problems and understand each in a way that many shows cannot even think about doing right, whereas The Bear knows exactly how to convey these situations in a way that feels impactful and deserving.`,
    content4: `When I saw most of the characters at first, I did not find any sort of special interest in any of them, but as the show developed and created more and more interesting scenarios for every character, I found them to be more and more interesting to the point where I was genuinely worried for their well being. Near the end of the series, I felt like they were becoming a family, and without realizing it, I had become part of that family.`,
    content5: `All of this praise is without even mentioning the wonderful technical aspects of the show that shine through, from Editing, visual and audio design, The carefully-chosen and sprinkled-throughout soundtrack and wonderful cinematography that encapsulates the feeling of living in Chicago, or in any big metropolis where it's easier to find a needle in a haystack than to find yourself. `,

       but I was at a loss of how to really make that a reality, until I discovered web development in a more in depth environment,
       which made me realize how much freedom I have to express myself through programming.`,

    content3: `I started to learn about coding, more specifically javascript, and then of course, react, the library that made it possible for me to create a website of my own,
    breaking through the barrier of my own creative limits.`,
